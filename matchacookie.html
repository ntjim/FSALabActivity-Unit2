                <h2>Matcha Cookies</h2>
                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 1/2 cups all purpose flour</li>
                    <li>2 1/2 tbsp matcha powder</li>
                    <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
                    <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
                    <li>1 tsp kosher salt</li>
                    <li>1 cup unsalted butter, room temp</li>
                    <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>1 large egg, room temp</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup coarse sugar, such as turbinado</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat oven - Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.</li>
                    <li>Sift dry ingredients - In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour, sifted matcha powder, baking soda, baking powder, and kosher salt and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Mix wet ingredients - In a separate large mixing bowl, use a handheld electric mixer or stand mixer and cream together butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until smooth and fluffy, about 1 to 2 minutes. Add the vanilla and egg and mix until combined. Use a silicone baking spatula and scrape the sides of the mixing bowl walls to bring the butter mixture to the center of the bowl.</li>
                    <li>Combine dry and wet ingredients - Gradually add in the dry ingredients and mix until the ingredients are just combined. Do not over-mix the dough.</li>
                    <li>Prepare cookie dough balls - Place the coarse sugar in a shallow bowl. Use a small ice cream scooper, cookie dough scooper, or tablespoon to scoop the dough and form 1.7 tablespoon (26 ml) cookie dough balls. Use your hands to roll the dough into balls and gently roll each ball in the sugar bowl until covered. Place the dough balls onto the prepared cookie sheets. Leave 1½-2 inches between each cookie to allow the dough to spread.</li>
                    <li>Bake the cookies - Bake for 8 to 10 minutes. The cookie will look soft in the middle and the edges will turn slightly golden. Let the cookies rest for 5 minutes on the cookie sheet then transfer to a wire cooling rack.</li>
